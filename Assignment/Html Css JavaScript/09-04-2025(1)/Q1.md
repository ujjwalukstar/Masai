# Debouncing and Throttling Explained

## What is Debouncing?

Debouncing is a technique used to ensure that an event handler executes **only once after a specific delay**, even if the event is triggered multiple times. It waits for a "calm period" before performing the action. If the event occurs again within the delay, the timer resets.

### Real-World Use Case

Imagine a **search bar** that provides suggestions as you type. Each keystroke triggers an event, but debouncing ensures that the search query is sent to the server only after the user stops typing. This reduces unnecessary API calls and optimizes performance.

## What is Throttling?

Throttling is a technique to limit the execution of an event handler to **fixed intervals**. Even if an event fires multiple times, the function executes only once every defined interval.

### Real-World Use Case

Picture a **scroll-based animation** that updates as the user scrolls down a web page. Throttling ensures the animation updates at regular intervals, regardless of how quickly or frequently the user scrolls, preventing performance issues.

## Key Differences Between Debouncing and Throttling

| Aspect               | Debouncing                                | Throttling                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Delays execution until the event stops firing | Executes at regular intervals during event firing |
| **Execution Frequency** | Only once after the delay              | At fixed intervals                       |
| **Use Cases**        | Search bars, form validations            | Scroll animations, window resizing       |
